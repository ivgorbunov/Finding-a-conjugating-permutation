# Permutations a, b are called conjugate if there is a permutation x such that b = x^{-1}ax. 
# (This is equivalent to their having the same type.) 
# We check if two permutations a, b given by the user are conjugate, and if they are, we find some  permutation x such that b = x^{-1}ax. 
# Use interactive compilers, like http://cpp.sh, choose language c++ 14
